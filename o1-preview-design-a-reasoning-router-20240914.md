User:

Construct a detailed design for how to incorporate o1, OpenAI's new reasoning model, into an AI system. The general idea should be that smaller, faster versions of models should be used as a router to decide, based on the user's task or message, when to use the strong reasoning model for complex reasoning tasks versus the more general model for tasks where that's appropriate. Please provide the design in a numbered bullets format and discuss how the different modules are connected to each other
