### **Summary and Style**
The entire infographic is dense with information, connecting text descriptions to various parts of the brain via colored arrows and lines. Red lines indicate inhibitory circuits, while other colored lines (blue, green, purple, orange, etc.) represent excitatory circuits. Each labeled area or pathway has icons or small graphics depicting its function or associated concept:
- For instance, the "Punishment" area includes icons of negative expressions or warnings.
- The "Pleasure" and "Rewards" system areas have smiling faces or positive imagery.

The text throughout the infographic uses scientific terms (like dendrites, axons, synapses, GABA, dopamine) to describe how neurons interact. There are references to how the brain’s electrical signals (action potentials) lead to firing neurons ("IF (D + G - GABA) > +20 mV Then FIRE").

**Overall**, the infographic aims to illustrate the brain’s complexity, specifically focusing on how the 8 sensory inputs (sight, smell, taste, touch, hearing, balance/acceleration, joint position, and possibly others such as internal bodily sensations) are processed through various neural pathways, leading to an immense number of neuron connections, and culminating in our behaviors, perceptions, and responses. Each segment is labeled and connected with lines to show the flow of information through different cortical areas and associated cognitive and emotional functions.
