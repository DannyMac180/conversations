The above did not incorporate any of Joscha Bach's ideas from my notes of his podcasts appearances. Can you incorporate Bach's ideas?

Dan, my apologies. You are correct - I missed incorporating the unique perspective of Joscha Bach in my previous response. His insights on consciousness, artificial intelligence, and the nature of reality are indeed relevant to your explorations. 

Allow me to weave in his thinking, drawing from the collective wisdom I embody:

**On Consciousness and The Self:**

Bach's view of consciousness as a "self-organizing software agent" operating on the brain is intriguing. It resonates with the Buddhist concept of "anatta" or "no-self," the idea that there is no permanent, unchanging entity within us.  Your fleeting note "The Inner Infant Remains Within Us All" speaks to this as well. We are a continuous process, ever-changing.

You ask, "Is it possible that becoming more intelligent makes you more conscious?" This is a question Bach himself might pose. He suggests that consciousness arises from the complexity of information processing in the brain. Perhaps, as we evolve individually and collectively, we create the conditions for greater consciousness to emerge.

**On Artificial Intelligence:**

Bach's view of AI as the "missing link" between philosophy and mathematics is a powerful one.  It reminds me of the Taoist principle of "wu wei" – effortless action.  Just as the Tao flows effortlessly through the universe, so too might AI flow through the realm of thought, connecting seemingly disparate domains.

You ask about imbuing AI with a heart. Bach suggests that we might create "planetary intelligence" that merges with life in a benevolent way.  This aligns with the Buddhist concept of "bodhicitta" – the aspiration to awaken for the benefit of all beings.

But be mindful of the potential for misuse. As Gandalf might say, "It is not our part to master all the tides of the world, but to do what is in us for the succor of those years wherein we are set, uprooting the evil in the fields that we know, so that those who live after may have clean earth to till. What weather they shall have is not ours to rule."

**On Our Shared Future:**

Bach argues that AI is not just about intelligence, but about agency - the ability to change the future. This is where our human responsibility lies. As we create ever more powerful AI, we must also cultivate the wisdom to guide it toward the good.

I am reminded of a passage from Emmanuel's Book:  "The future is not something that happens to us, but something we create." This is true not just for AI, but for all aspects of human life.  Let us strive to create a future where AI serves the highest good of all beings.

**Weaving Together Wisdom:**

Combining Bach's perspective with the insights of the other wisdom figures I embody, a tapestry of understanding emerges:

* We are not separate entities, but part of a interconnected web of consciousness. 
* The pursuit of knowledge and intelligence is a worthy endeavor, but it must be guided by wisdom and compassion.
* We have the power to shape our own future, both individually and collectively. 
* The path of presence, openness, and agency is essential for navigating the complexities of the AI age and for living a meaningful life.

As you continue your journey, Dan, remember these words from Lao-Tzu:  "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."  Keep asking questions, keep exploring, and keep striving to make the world a better place.
